## Version Release Checklist

### Pre-Release (Version X.Y.Z)

#### 1. Version Bump
- [ ] Update `pyproject.toml` `version = "X.Y.Z"`
- [ ] Update `README.md` `**Version:** X.Y.Z` (line 5)
- [ ] Update `helm/Chart.yaml`:
  - [ ] `version: X.Y.Z` (chart version)
  - [ ] `appVersion: "X.Y.Z"` (app version)
- [ ] Verify `tram/__init__.py` reads version from `importlib.metadata` (no hardcoded version)

#### 2. CHANGELOG Update
- [ ] Move `## [Unreleased]` items to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
- [ ] Add comparison link at bottom: `[X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/tosumitdhaka/tram/compare/vX.Y.(Z-1)...vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Create new empty `## [Unreleased]` section

#### 3. Documentation Sync
- [ ] All version references in docs match X.Y.Z
- [ ] `README.md` / `docs/index.md` quick-start examples use `latest`, with production pin guidance for X.Y.Z
- [ ] Helm install examples use `latest` for quick start or pin `image.tag=X.Y.Z` for release-specific docs
- [ ] `helm/values.yaml` default image tag matches X.Y.Z
- [ ] Auth docs match implementation: `TRAM_AUTH_USERS` bootstrap behavior and DB `scrypt` password storage
- [ ] Feature tables include version tags (e.g., "v1.1.0")

#### 4. Testing (Full Suite)
- [ ] `pytest tests/unit/ -v` — all pass
- [ ] `pytest tests/integration/ -v` — all pass
- [ ] `pytest tests/ --cov=tram --cov-fail-under=60` — coverage OK

- [ ] Test dry-run on at least 3 example pipelines
- [ ] Test template download endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8765/api/templates`

#### 6. CI/CD Check
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs successfully on main branch

- [ ] No flaky tests

#### 7. Git Commit
- [ ] Stage version bump files:
  ```bash
  git add pyproject.toml README.md docs/changelog.md helm/Chart.yaml
  ```
- [ ] Commit with message: `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z`
- [ ] **Do NOT push yet** — verify release workflow first

#### 8. Release Workflow Verification
- [ ] Check `.github/workflows/release.yml` is configured
- [ ] Verify Docker registry credentials are set (GitHub secrets)
- [ ] Verify Helm chart registry is configured
- [ ] Verify release workflow publishes both versioned and `latest` tags for manager and worker images

---

### Release (Create Tag)

- [ ] Create and push tag:
  ```bash
  git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
  git push origin vX.Y.Z
  ```

---

### Post-Release

#### 1. GitHub Release
- [ ] Create GitHub release from tag `vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Copy CHANGELOG entry for X.Y.Z into release notes
- [ ] Attach any relevant artifacts (if applicable)
- [ ] Mark as "Latest release"

#### 2. Verification
- [ ] Test pull image: `docker pull ghcr.io/tosumitdhaka/trishul-ram:X.Y.Z`

  ```bash
  git tag -f latest
  git push origin latest --force
  ```

#### 4. Announce
- [ ] Update any external documentation
- [ ] Notify users/team of new release
- [ ] Post release notes to relevant channels

---

## Hotfix Release Checklist

For urgent fixes (X.Y.Z+1):

- [ ] Create hotfix branch: `git checkout -b hotfix/X.Y.(Z+1) vX.Y.Z`
- [ ] Apply minimal fix (no new features)
- [ ] Follow **Pre-Release** checklist (version X.Y.Z+1)
- [ ] Test thoroughly (unit + integration)
- [ ] Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge hotfix/X.Y.(Z+1)`
- [ ] Follow **Release** checklist
- [ ] Delete hotfix branch: `git branch -d hotfix/X.Y.(Z+1)`

---

## Rollback Checklist

If a release has critical issues:

- [ ] Identify last known good version (X.Y.Z-1)
- [ ] Tag rollback release: `vX.Y.Z-rollback` pointing to `vX.Y.Z-1`
- [ ] Update Helm deployments:
  ```bash
  helm upgrade tram oci://ghcr.io/tosumitdhaka/charts/trishul-ram --version X.Y.Z-1
  ```
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG with rollback note
- [ ] Communicate issue and rollback to users
- [ ] Create issue to track fix for next release

---

## Notes

- **Always test locally before pushing** — CI catches most issues, but local verification is faster
- **Never skip tests** — coverage regression means something important is untested
- **Version bumps are atomic** — all version references must change together
- **CHANGELOG is user-facing** — write clear, concise entries with examples
- **Tag format is strict** — always `vX.Y.Z` (lowercase 'v' prefix)

## v1.2.2 — 2026-04-15

### Fixes
- `tram/cli/main.py` — `validate` and `run --dry-run` crashed unpacking `(config, raw_yaml)` tuple returned by `load_pipeline()`
- `tram/watcher/pipeline_watcher.py` — hot-reload raised `PipelineAlreadyExistsError` on changed YAML; fixed by passing `replace=True` to `manager.register()`
- `docs/api.md` — response shapes for dry-run, connector-test, and change-password corrected to match implementation
- `docs/connectors.md` — `on_error` valid values corrected (`continue | abort | retry | dlq`; `stop` was never valid)
- `pyproject.toml` — removed `tram[corba]` from `all` extra; `omniORBpy` is a system package with no PyPI wheel (CI was failing)
- `tests/unit/test_auth_utils.py` — `test_returns_sha256_prefix` → `test_returns_scrypt_prefix`; password hasher was upgraded to scrypt in v1.2.1 but test was not updated

- `docs/changelog.md` — moved from `CHANGELOG.md` (root)

- `README.md` — overhauled: use-case driven (PM, FM, gNMI, syslog, CORBA), concise, links to docs
- `.gitignore` — added `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.codex`

### Tests
- Coverage raised from ~67% to 78.5% (1,296 passing, 0 failed)
- 9 new test files covering AI router, CLI, daemon server, pipeline manager/controller/watcher, API middleware, stats, serializers
- 25 ruff lint errors in test files resolved

### Version bumps
- `pyproject.toml` → `1.2.2`
- `helm/Chart.yaml` → `1.2.2`
